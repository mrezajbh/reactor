Chemical engineering modeling is undergoing a transformation, and Python is at the forefront! 
I'm excited to share my recent work developing a comprehensive Python-based reactor simulator, designed to tackle the complex challenges of multi-component fuel oxidation. This project aligns closely with my research interests and directly addresses the need for advanced modeling tools in the development of sustainable fuels for the maritime.
The code is available in my GitHub repository: https://lnkd.in/dwEDMi6X 
Tired of being limited by traditional tools? Python is empowering chemical engineers with its versatile ecosystem of libraries, faster solvers, and seamless integration with cutting-edge technologies like AI and machine learning.
In my latest project, I developed a comprehensive reactor simulator in Python, demonstrating the advantages of this approach. The model focuses on a specific set of reactions crucial for understanding real-world processes:
Combustion of Methane (CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O): A fundamental reaction for energy production and a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.
Ammonia Oxidation (NH₃ + 1.5O₂ → NO + 1.5H₂O): A key step in nitric acid production, with significant implications for environmental pollution.
Steam Reforming of Methane (CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂): A primary method for producing hydrogen, a vital feedstock for various industries.

Model specification:
LHHW Kinetics: Accurately models complex reaction kinetics on catalytic surfaces.
NRTL Activity Coefficients: Captures non-ideal behavior of liquid mixtures, crucial for real-world accuracy.
Peng-Robinson Equation of State: Handles gas phase thermodynamics, enabling accurate pressure and volume calculations.
Dynamic Mass Transfer: Considers the critical role of mass transfer in influencing reaction rates and product distribution.
Heat Exchange Modeling: Incorporates heat transfer effects, reflecting the real-world thermal dynamics of reactors.
Seamless AI Integration: Outputs from the Python simulator can be directly fed into AI/ML models for advanced analysis, optimization, and predictive control.
With Python, we can break free from the constraints of legacy software and unlock new possibilities for modeling, simulation, and optimization in chemical engineering.
